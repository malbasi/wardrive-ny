          New York City has an abundance of signals. The constant chatter of other people, the hum of traffic, the visual information from the tower buildings. In NY, The senses are constantly bombarded with information from all directions. But even if we closed our eyes and somehow quieted the people and stopped the cars, the city is still inundated with signals. While imperceptible to us, the invisible RF signals bounced from rooftop to rooftop connect each of the millions of cellphones and devices which connect us to one another.
          </p>
          <p>
          These invisible signals are easy to forget. Most consumer gadgets work to hide the complicated underpinnings of how they work. A cellphone would never ask which cell tower it should connect to or which satellite the GPS should use. Instead, a sleek user interface covers most of the ingenious engineering to create a frictionless experience. Most of the time, hiding these complicated tidbits make the user’s experience all the better, but occasionally it creates security flaws that governments, law enforcement and criminals can use to their advantage. That’s the case with your cellphone, some of the most basic, fundamental engineering protocols that underlie every call and text are broken and we have no idea who is taking advantage of this or how often it is broken.

          The equipment needed to exploit these flaws go by many names. They are commonly referenced as Stingrays, IMSI catchers or cell-site simulators and they are very expensive. A TK TK contractor Harris Corporation is one of the only manufacturers of the equipment. While price lists are kept secret and the company can not sell to anyone without special permission from the FBI, FOIA requests have uncovered some details.

          Stingrays allow an attacker to do a common attack method called Man in the Middle. By exploiting the TK TK TK vulnerabilities in the cellular protocols, the Stingray is able to monitor and possibly intercept any signal from a trapped phone.

              If these security flaws are present on nearly every cellphone, that means the targets for such an attack are legion. The phone calls and text messages of a common citizen may not be that interesting, but what about a banker, a CEO or the president? If they use a cellphone that uses the standard cellular protocols, their information is at risk too. Short of waiting for DHS to release a vaguely worded press release, how do we know if we’re under attack?

            In TK, researchers at University of Washington TK TK privacy lab decided to look for stingrays in the wild. Pete Ney, then a PhD candidate, and his team of TK TK TK developed a device that would connect to the nearest cellphone tower, ask for its credentials and store them in a database. They paid uber drives in TK and TK to install the devices in their cars while they drove around the city. After TK weeks of collecting data, Ney and his team set out to analyze what they found.

            Their findings were interesting, but incomplete. At the airport in TK TK TK they found a cell tower that would TK TK TK. At an ICE building in TK TK TK they found another which would TK TK TK. But verifying that these signals were actually stingrays proved to be difficult.

            TK and TK have an abundance of targets for someone wanting to use a stingray, but it doesn’t have anywhere near the density of targets as NYC. New York is the epicenter of business, media and politics. IBM, Facebook, Google all have a home here. The New York Stock Exchange controls TK TK of dollars a day. The United Nations hosts diplomats and staff from TK countries around the world. The NSA, DHS, FBI and CIA all have a presence here, not to mention the NYPD, one of the largest police forces in the nation. If you wanted to find someone worth spying on, New York City is the place to do it. So, stingrays must be everywhere, right? What would we find if we deployed these sensors here in the big apple?

            Ney and his team didn’t stop working on SeaGlass after their first sweep. They began to develop more advanced equipment and started testing actual IMSI catchers in controlled environments to see exactly what they would look like in the data.

        Before setting out to find Stingrays in NY, we had to devise a strategy. We knew the types of places that might be vulnerable to attack and the people who might have access to the equipment, so we began to map the points of interest across Manhattan. We were limited by the number of devices and the time available, so we constructed a few routes that would cover most of the areas we were interested in. 
      </p>

      <p>
        To find a stingray we would need to be in the right place at the right time. In other words, one of our sensors would need to be within range of a Stingray (around 0.5 km) at the exact time it was powered on. We needed an overlap of time and place. After a few practice runs to test the devices and the readouts, and one incredibly long day on a city bike, we had a basic lay of the land. Now it was time to start serious collection. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of four days and 105 miles, the sensor was driven around the city on the back of a bike messenger, Sandro. After responding to a Craigslist ad and with the promise of $50 a day, Sandro set out to work while passively collecting information about every cell tower he passed. Hopefully, if the fates were in our favor, he would be in the right place at the right time and capture a stingray.

        If these devices were in use everywhere, there is a good chance Sandro would have passed one. Over the course of a few days, he traveled from the upper west side, to the tip of the island and almost everywhere in between. He passed the UN, embassies and consulates from many different countries, big banks, Wall Street and more than a few local and federal government buildings.

        We delivered the data to Ney for his analysis which, at this time, is done by hand. Ney spent a few days combing through what we delivered. Pete called me over the weekend. Sitting in the garden of a Harlem apartment on a Sunday afternoon, the told me the results

        Despite a pang of what I can only call disappointment, we did a thorough job of collecting data for the first time in New York City. The result is a map of the 3G spectrum that can be used for future research as a baseline for comparison. Since one of the issues with hunting Stingrays is verifying the “ground truth,” the data we have now can be used to compare new data to what is expected of the cellular landscape.

      <p>
        TK TK quote from Cooper about how this data can be used going forward TK TK
      </p>
      <p>
        The methods used for this analysis are not bulletproof. Foremost among them is the ‘right time right place’ requirement of the devices. It could be that stingrays were in use around the city during our sweeps and the device simply wasn’t nearby while they were on. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing is newer versions of IMSI catchers could have avoided our detection. Our devices were searching on the 3g network that was in popular use until 4g became the dominant network in the US around 2009. Some IMSI catchers force the target phone to use the 3g network because it has more security flaws that can be exploited, but newer IMSI catchers are thought to work completely on 4g.
